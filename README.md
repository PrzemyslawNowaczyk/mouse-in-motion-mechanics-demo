# mouse-in-motion-mechanics-demo (2017)
Physics-based 2D game with adobrable, yet squared rodent.

Main goal of this little project was to gain better understaing of Unity physics. Later I was planning to turn it into small adventure game. Unfortunaltelly, project was abandoned, due to lack of time and motivation.
